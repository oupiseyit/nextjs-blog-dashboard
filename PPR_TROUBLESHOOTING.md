# Partial Prerendering (PPR) Troubleshooting Guide

## Current Configuration ✅

Your PPR setup is correctly configured:

1. **Next.js Config**: `ppr: "incremental"` in `next.config.ts`
2. **Dashboard Layout**: `export const experimental_ppr = true`
3. **Dashboard Page**: `export const experimental_ppr = true`
4. **Suspense Boundaries**: Properly wrapped async components
5. **Next.js Version**: 15.4.0-canary.110 (supports PPR)

## Potential Issues & Solutions

### 1. Database Connection During Build

PPR requires data to be fetchable during build time. Ensure:

-   Database is accessible during build
-   Environment variables are properly set
-   Network connectivity is stable

### 2. Development vs Production

PPR behavior differs between dev and production:

-   **Development**: PPR might not be fully active
-   **Production**: Run `pnpm build` to see PPR in action

### 3. Verification Steps

#### Check Build Output

Look for PPR indicators in build output:

```bash
pnpm build
```

You should see route analysis showing:

-   `○` (Static) - Prerendered at build time
-   `◐` (PPR) - Partial Prerendering enabled
-   `λ` (Dynamic) - Server-rendered on each request

#### Check Network Tab

In production:

1. Initial page load should show static content immediately
2. Dynamic parts should stream in progressively
3. Look for multiple responses to the same route

### 4. Common Issues

#### Issue: PPR not working in development

**Solution**: PPR is optimized for production. Test with:

```bash
pnpm build && pnpm start
```

#### Issue: Database errors during build

**Solution**: Ensure database is accessible and environment variables are set

#### Issue: Suspense boundaries not working

**Solution**: Verify async components are properly wrapped and data fetching throws promises

## Testing PPR

1. **Build the project**: `pnpm build`
2. **Start production server**: `pnpm start`
3. **Open browser with Network tab**
4. **Navigate to dashboard**
5. **Observe loading patterns**

Expected behavior:

-   Static content (header, navigation) loads immediately
-   Loading skeletons appear for dynamic sections
-   Dynamic content streams in as data becomes available

## Next Steps

If PPR still isn't working:

1. Check browser Network tab for streaming responses
2. Verify database connectivity
3. Test with simplified data fetching
4. Check Next.js build logs for PPR indicators
